-- Getting Started --

Run 'python3 repo_fetch.py'
Follow through the prompt to enter usernames that you want information on (Max 10).
A JSON file containing information on repos should be generated.
Start a live server in the base directory via 'serve' or other methods.
Navigate to the correct localhost port.


-- Challenges --

I spent too much time on JavaScript formatting.
I should have created a working prototype, then refactored with extra time.


-- Future Updates --

Due to time constraints I was not able to implement the functionality to view information on individual users, nor the ability to filter languages.
Optimize repo fetching script.
Organize files.
